This small project allows you to decode DDEX files into friendly Python data types. XML files are decoded using the PyXB
library.

Please leave an issue or submit a pull request if you are experiencing any issue. Keep in mind that this is a fairly
low level library that only aims at making DDEX files easier to read using Python. Some DDEX data structures expose
lists containing only one element, and some value like UpdateIndicator are not cast as booleans.

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://ddexreader.readthedocs.org.

Features
--------

* Open an XML file into a DDEX data structure generated by pyxb corresponding to the DDEX version
* Parse this DDEX data structure into a Python dict.

Quickstart
----------

```
from ddexreader import open_ddex, ddex_to_dict

xml_path = '/path/to/my/ddex_file.xml'
ddex = open_ddex(xml_path)
ddex_dict = ddex_to_dict(ddex)
```

How to add more DDEX definitions
--------------------------------

After installing pyxb on your (unix) system, enter:

```
pyxbgen -u [the url to the definition file]
```
